/**
 * App Component Test Suite
 * 
 * This file contains unit tests for the main App component of the Signal School Frontend.
 * The tests verify that the component renders correctly and displays expected content.
 * 
 * Currently includes a basic smoke test to ensure the component renders without crashing.
 * This test should be updated to reflect the actual content and functionality of the App component.
 * 
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Component rendering without errors
 * - Presence of expected UI elements
 * - User type routing (could be expanded)
 * - Loading state behavior (could be expanded)
 * 
 * Note: This test currently checks for "learn react" text which is not present
 * in the actual App component and should be updated to match the real implementation.

 * TODO: Update this test to check for actual App component content like:
 * - Loading screen elements
 * - Login interface for unauthenticated users
 * - Admin/Teacher interfaces for authenticated users
